# Backend

  At the `Backend` of this App, A `Nodejs` server is running, which manages all the `requests` and `responses` from the user. 
This App Uses Some Node_Modules in order to work properly which include:
- `Mongoose`
  - To make requests from the backend to MongoDB
- `cors`
    - allows a server to indicate any origins other than its own from which a browser should permit loading resources.
- `Express`
  - create a web-server
  - handles request and response
- `JSON Web Token`
  - To create cookies and tokens
- `bcrypt`
  - To convert passwords into a fixed-length character called hash to store it in encrypted form in the database.
- `nodemailer`
  - To send a verification mail to the user.
- Used the `Socket.io` module for a two-way connection between client and server.
- For end-to-end encryption here we are not storing the messages and hence when the page reloads all the chats disappear.

# Database

We are using `MongoDB` for all its database needs. This App uses DB to:
 
 - Store tokens for email verification when the user first-time signs up.
 - Store information regarding the user.
 - Stores the password of the user in encrypted form. 
 - Storing and updating cookies so that the user does not have to log in every time.
 - Storing and updating the socket ID of the users for them to chat privately.

# Future Aspirations for this App

There are some features that can be added in the future:
- Store the users' chat without compromising their privacy.
- Add audio and video call options.
- Facility to create chat rooms or groups.
- Profile pictures and about the user section to make it more user-friendly and interactive.
